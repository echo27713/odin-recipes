    <h4>Pesto Pizza</h4>
    <p>A friend brought a version of this to a dinner party as an appetizer, she also added a little mozarella and parmesan cheese, it was a hit! It really looks pretty if you top it with the cheeses and then lay big slices of fresh tomato over the top.</p>
    <p>This was really expensive to make and was a major disappointment. Won't be making this one again.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1(12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pesto</li>
        <li>1 ripe tomato, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread pesto on pizza crust. Top with tomatoes, bell peppers, olives, red onions, artichoke hearts and feta cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and browned.</li>
    </ol>
