    <h4>Hearty Vegetable Lasagna</h4>
    <p>Finally! A veggie lasagna I like. I added thawed and drained frozen spinach to the ricotta mixture (what is lasagna without spinach?), and I also followed other suggestions and added about 3/4 cup each of finally chopped carrot, broccoli, and zucchini. It was great. This recipe has become my mainstay for veggie lasagna.</p>
    <p>This is a decent base recipe, but the proportion of the ingredients I felt was way off. A whole package of lasagna was way too much. I used 12 noodles total. I also felt 2 jars of pasta sauce would have totally drowned this lasagna, and I am a huge sauce fan and tend to use more than others.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1(16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</li>
    </ol>
