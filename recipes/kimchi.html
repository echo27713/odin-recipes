    <h4>Baek Kimchi(White Kimchi)</h4>
    <p>Homemade baek kimchi (white kimchi), a Korean staple, is easy to make at home using napa cabbage, daikon radish, garlic, and vinegar.</p>
    <p>un and easy, will make again. I had to substitute for a few things I don't keep on hand. I used pickling salt, prepared horseradish sauce and sweet chilli sauce (1/4 cup each), and omitted the added sugar, salt, vinegar, radish and red peppers. I minced crystallized ginger, fresh scallions and fresh garlic. The instruction to wrap the outer leaf around the cabbage section did not make any sense to me, the leaf being much too small. I sprinkled the mixture</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head napa cabbage</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salts</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly grated white radish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut cabbage lengthwise into quarters, keeping the leaves attached to the core. Rinse cabbage with cold water and liberally sprinkle 3 tablespoons salt between the leaves. Place cabbage in a large bowl and add just enough water to cover. Set aside until leaves are soft, 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse the salted cabbage 3 or 4 times with cold water and drain in a colander for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup water, radish, green onions, garlic, ginger, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, vinegar, and red pepper threads in a bowl. Sprinkle radish mixture between all the cabbage leaves except for the large outer leaf of each quarter. Reserve the liquid from the radish mixture.</li>
    </ol>
